                <h2>Welcome to the Official DC Universe</h2>
                <p>The DC Universe (DCU) is the fictional shared universe where most stories in American comic book titles published by DC Comics take place. DC superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Booster Gold are from this universe, and it also contains well-known supervillains such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Brainiac, Lady Shiva, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Cheetah, and Darkseid. In context, the term "DC Universe" usually refers to the main DC continuity. The term "DC Multiverse" refers to the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications.

                <br>
                Within the Multiverse, the main DC Universe has gone by many names, but in recent years has been referred to by "Prime Earth" (not to be confused with "Earth Prime") or "Earth 0". The main DC Universe, as well as the alternate realities related to it, began as the first shared universe in comic books and were quickly adapted to other media such as film serials or radio dramas. In subsequent decades, the continuity between all of these media became increasingly complex with certain storylines and events designed to simplify or streamline the more confusing aspects of characters' histories.</p>

               <h3>Best Animated DC Movie <span>(DC-Animated-Universe)</span></h3><br><br>
               <p><b><u>Batman: Under The Red Hood</u></b><br><br>It couldn't be anything else. Batman: Under the Red Hood is a dark, unflinching, and faithful tale of Jason Todd's return to life that smartly emphasizes his hatred for The Joker and his lack of understanding towards Batman's no-kill rule. As a whole, the film is an emotional and action-packed roller coaster (with great vocal performances by Bruce Greenwood, Jensen Ackles, and John DiMaggio), but the final few minutes between Batman, Joker, and Jason are what elevate it to pure classic status.</p>
